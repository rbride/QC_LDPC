# QC_LDPC
RTL design for a "5G" multigigabit QC-LDPC pipelined encoder in System Verilog. 

Implements code length of 1296, at a rate of 5/6, and uses the RU Algorithm in conjunction with various other optimizations derived from research publications to create an high throughput QC-LDPC Encoder. 

The goal of this project was to put one together as quickly (yet still accurate) as possible.
